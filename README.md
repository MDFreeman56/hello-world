MIKE

I am an Estimator for a Landscape company looking to create MIKE (Machine Intelligent Kind Equipment).
MIKE is the vision of AI at Emanouil Inc.  MIKE will be a 3D / virtual Landscape Architect with the ability of reading specs and architectural drawings, emailing companies for quotes, and performing takeoffs.  MIKE will also create operational time allowances, staffing plans, and asset requirement.  MIKE will use that information combined with current projects to create staffing and vendor schedules for the project managers. MIKE will measure the EBIT and create P & L statements of each project.
